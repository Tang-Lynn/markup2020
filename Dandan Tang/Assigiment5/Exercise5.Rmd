## Exercise
Create a presentation about any topic you like that consists of at least 7 slides and includes all of the following:

- a logo
- a centered still figure
- an interactive table
- a moving figure, interactive figure or movie
- a 2-column slide
- an aligned multi-row equation
- a citation and reference list
- r-code, displayed but not executed
- cached r-code (may overlap with the next requirement)
- r-code, executed, but not displayed (e.g. a figure generation)

## An interactive table
```{r}
sesamesim[,4:9] %>% 
  datatable(options = list(pageLength = 7))
```


## A interactive figure
```{r}
p <- ggplot(data = diamonds, aes(x = cut, fill = clarity)) +
  geom_bar(position = "dodge")
ggplotly(p)
```

## An interactive table warning = FALSE
```{r warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
library(xtable)
dat <- sesamesim[1:3,10:15] %>% head
xtable(dat)
```

## A 2-column slide
  Markup Languages and Reproducible Programming in Statistics
  :::::: {.cols data-latex=""}

::: {.col data-latex="{0.55\textwidth}"}
This course gives an overview of the state-of-the-art in statistical markup, reproducible programming and scientific digital representation. Students will get to know the professional field of statistical markup and its innovations and challenges. 
:::

::: {.col data-latex="{0.5\textwidth}"}
The students get acquainted with different viewpoints on marking up statistical manuscripts, areas of innovation, and challenges that people face when working with, analysing and reporting (simulated) data. Knowledge obtained from this course will help students face multidimensional problems during their professional career.

## An aligned multi-row equation
```

BF_{N} = \frac{\mathcal{N}(\mu=0 | \overline{y}, \frac{s^2}{N})}{\mathcal{N}(\mu=0 | 0, \frac{1}{b}\frac{s^2}{N})}

where $\overline{y}$ and $s^2$ denote the sample mean and the unbiased sample variance, respectively

```

## A citation and reference list
